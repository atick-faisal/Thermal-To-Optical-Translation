## Runs

| Run | Date | What ran | Task | Machine | Headline | Findings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [001](001-e1-reference-bracket.md) | 2026-08-12 | E1 reference bracket: {thermal, visible}-trained detector × {raw thermal, real visible} | M0.10 | Windows server, 2× A100 | visible-trained detector: 0.1887 mAP50 on raw thermal vs 0.9213 on visible | F01, F02 |

## Findings

| ID | Claim | Run | Status | Acts on / acted on by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F01 | In-domain detection > 0.9 mAP50 on both modalities; the domain gap, not the sensor, is the problem | 001 | open | |
| F02 | A visible-trained detector collapses to 0.1887 mAP50 on raw thermal (0.9213 on visible); Switch and Fuse near zero, Pole 0.5551 | 001 | open | |
