"""Shared config machinery: the strict base model, the error type, and the YAML merge.

PLAN.md §13 records a deliberate deviation from ``../Clean-SeAFusion/src/seafusion/config.py``:
pydantic v2 replaces that module's hand-rolled ``_build``/``_coerce``/``_to_plain``
reflection, keeping its two best behaviours -- unknown-key rejection and ``snapshot()``.

Unknown keys are rejected rather than ignored. A silently-dropped typo in a training config
costs a full run to discover, so the trade is heavily in favour of failing fast.
